Hey guys... I thought its been a while since I posted something so I thought why not write my experience working with django.

First of all django is a great framework to develop websites. Many people feel flask is better but I feel django is a better framework for beginners like me.

So at first when my mentor told me to create a shopping cart, I was completely blank. He then sent me the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/) of django. All I would say is that it is a great documentation but it is so vast that they have covered every corner of this framework which is quite nice. But for noobies and aspiring developers like us, it is a bit too much of a read.
Well they have explained the app making in django using an example which is the best part of the documentation.

Well if you are a video learner, then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK) is one of the better playlists to learn. It covers most of the things from scratch, assuming you know a bit of python and liquid syntax. 

One of the most important thing I came across is that one has to understand the MVT structure. It will create a base for future developing as well.

Then I would say if a person has mastered the model making then he or she can find the the rest of the django very easy to work on.

I have made a shopping cart myself :)

Well I guess thats it for today...I will see if I can make tutorial on django.

All the best and never stop building.  (\\(^_^)/)

Stay tuned for more..
