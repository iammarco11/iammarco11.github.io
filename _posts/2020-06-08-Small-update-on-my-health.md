Hello all, yeah it has been a while since I blogged. Well I was just busy with my GSoC proposal and some personal projects. I was down with fever for the last couple of status, thankfully its not COVID :). But I don't know why I am feeling fatigue and weak even after the fever is over. I think lack of exercise and physical activity is leading to this. Back at college I atleast had some physical activity of walking 5.4 kms minimum back and forth from college and hostel. Anyway there is this small heart ache also which is looming these days. I mean not a very major pain, just a feeling a small pain near the heart area. I hope it is due to gas, but I am a bit scared about the same as it had never occured to me before. Neither I used to have gas problems in the past. Putting everything aside I think it is time to get involved in more physical activities and spare some time for walks like I used to have in college. I think its better to reduce the intake of junk food from outside as well. Anyway I will keep you guys updated on a bot I and the networks team have been working on. Something like a pre-release statement :P.<br>

Cheers <3,<br>
